        <h1>Introduction to an Artist</h1>
            <p>I'm Rachel and I'm an interdisciplinary artist. I dabble mostly in painting, sculpting, and metalsmithing.</p>

        <h2>Painting</h2>
            <p>I began painting portraits 2 years ago and really enjoy it. I have painted a few types of portraits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pet Portraits</li>
                    <li>Human Portraits</li>
                </ul>

    <section id="sculpting">   
            <h3>Sculpting</h3>
            <p>I have only played around with clay hand modeling, but I would like to try the following in order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Throwing clay.</li>
                    <li>Firing in the kiln.</li>
                    <li>Glazing</li>
                </ol>

    <section id="metalsmithing">       
        <h4>Metalsmithing</h4>
            <p>I enjoy this medium a lot, but it's costly to get started so I haven't done as much here as I would like.  Ideally I would love to make large, chunky rings featuring lots of stones and fossils, as well as learning casting techniques.</p>
