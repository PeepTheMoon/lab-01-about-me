        <h1>Introduction to an Artist</h1>
            <p id="intro">I'm Rachel Donahue at Peep the Moon Studios, and I'm an interdisciplinary artist.<br/> I dabble mostly in painting, but I also enjoy illustration, sculpting, and metalsmithing.</p>

        <h2>Painting</h2>
        <p>I began painting more than 17 years ago and really enjoy it. I recently began painting portraits of both animal and human subjects.</p>

            <h3>Sculpting</h3>
            <p>I have only played around with clay hand modeling, but I would like to try the following in order:</p>
                <ol class="plans">
                    <li class="plans1">1. Throwing clay.</li>
                    <li class="plans2">2. Firing in the kiln.</li>
                    <li class="plans3">3. Glazing</li>
                </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="metalsmithing">       
        <h4>Metalsmithing</h4>
            <p>I enjoy this medium a lot, but it's costly to get started so I haven't done as much here as I would like.  Ideally I would love to make large, chunky rings featuring lots of stones and fossils, as well as learning casting techniques.</p>
